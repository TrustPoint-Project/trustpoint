 * PlantUML can occasionally display sponsored or advertising messages. Those
 * messages are usually generated on welcome or error images and never on
 * functional diagrams.
 * See https://plantuml.com/professional if you want to remove them
 *
 * Images (whatever their format : PNG, SVG, EPS...) generated by running PlantUML
 * are owned by the author of their corresponding sources code (that is, their
 * textual description in PlantUML language). Those images are not covered by
 * this MIT license.
 *
 * The generated images can then be used without any reference to the MIT license.
 * It is not even necessary to stipulate that they have been generated with PlantUML,
 * although this will be appreciated by the PlantUML team.
 *
 * There is an exception : if the textual description in PlantUML language is also covered
 * by any license, then the generated images are logically covered
 * by the very same license.
 *
 * This is the IGY distribution (Install GraphViz by Yourself).
 * You have to install GraphViz and to setup the GRAPHVIZ_DOT environment variable
 * (see https://plantuml.com/graphviz-dot )
