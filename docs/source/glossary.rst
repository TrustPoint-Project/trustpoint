Glossary
============

Certificate
...........
A certificate refers to a X.509 certificate, which contains the corresponding public key.

|

Private Key
...........
A private key of an asymmetric key pair. A public key can usually be derived or is contained in a private key object.

|

Public Key
..........
A key that can be shared publicly and is used to verify the digital signature created by the corresponding private key.

|

Certificate Chain
.................
The certificate chain corresponding to a certificate, including the Root CA certificate, but excluding the
certificate itself that the certificate chain is concerned about.

|

Credential
..........
A credential is a set of a private key, corresponding certificate and certificate chain. Both the certificate and
private key implicitly include the public key.

|

Domain Credential
.................
A domain credential is the credential the device will acquire when onboarding to a domain. This
credential is then used to authenticate itself against the Trustpoint and thus allows the device to
request application certificates corresponding to that domain.

|

Root CA
........
A trusted Certificate Authority that is the anchor of trust in a PKI. It is used to sign Issuing CAs and other subordinate certificates, establishing the basis for the certificate chain.

|

Issuing CA
..........
An Issuing CA is an entity on the Trustpoint that issues new certificates while forcing all certificates
in the certificate hierarchy to utilize the same Signature-Suite, that is the same signature algorithm and the same
hash function.

|

Registration Authority (RA)
...........................
An entity that acts as an intermediary between end-users and the Certificate Authority (CA), responsible for accepting certificate requests, authenticating the requestor's identity, and forwarding the requests to the CA for certificate issuance.

|

Self-Generated Root and Issuing CA
..................................
A configuration within Trustpoint where the system generates its own Root Certificate Authority and Issuing Certificate Authority.

.. warning::

      Self-Generated Root and Issuing CAs are primarily intended for testing purposes to simulate a complete certificate issuance environment without relying on external CAs.

|

Signature Suite
...............
A combination of a signature algorithm and a hash function used to create digital signatures. It ensures that certificates issued under a particular domain maintain consistent cryptographic properties.

|

Onboarding
..........
Onboarding describes the process of acquiring a first credential, the domain credential, which allows
the device to authenticate itself against the Trustpoint and thus request further application
certificates from that domain.

|

User-Driven Onboarding
......................
A method where users manually initiate and control the process of adding devices to Trustpoint, utilizing tools such as the Trustpoint Client, command-line interfaces, browser-based interfaces, or by manually downloading and distributing PKCS#12 files.

|

Zero-Touch Onboarding
.....................
An automated onboarding process, currently under development, designed to allow devices to be added to Trustpoint without manual intervention, streamlining the integration of new devices into the system.

|

Domain
......
Domains are an abstraction on top of the Issuing CAs. Every Domain has exactly one Issuing CA assosiated to it,
while an Issuing CA can be part of multiple domains.

Certificates associated with a domain will always have the same Signature-Suite (compare Issuing-CA)

|

Trust-Store
...........
Trust-Stores are sets of certificates that are trustworthy. The Trustpoint can be configured to offer arbitrary
Trust-Stores in any domain which can then be requested and stored within the Trustpoint-Client.

|

Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
.................................
A list of certificates that have been revoked by the Certificate Authority before their scheduled expiration date, indicating that they should no longer be trusted.

|

CSR (Certificate Signing Request)
.................................
A message sent from an applicant to a Certificate Authority to request the issuance of a digital certificate. It typically contains the applicant’s public key and identifying information.

|

PKCS#12
.......
PKCS#12 (Public Key Cryptography Standards #12) is a binary format used to store cryptographic objects, such as private keys, certificates, and any related intermediate chain certificates. A PKCS#12 file is often used to bundle these objects into a single file, making it easy to transport and securely protect using a password. Common file extensions for PKCS#12 files are .p12 or .pfx.

|

PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail)
...........................
PEM is a base64-encoded format often used for storing cryptographic keys and certificates, typically with extensions such as .pem, .crt, .cer, or .key. PEM files are ASCII-text and are easily readable, with headers like -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE-----, making them versatile for use in different environments and applications.

|

EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport)
......................................
A protocol used for securely enrolling devices with a Certificate Authority, allowing for the automated issuance and renewal of digital certificates.

|

CMP (Certificate Management Protocol)
.....................................
A protocol used for managing digital certificates within a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), including certificate issuance, renewal, and revocation.

|

Application Certificates
........................
Digital certificates issued by Trustpoint for specific applications or systems (like TLS server/client, OPC UA server/client), enabling secure communication and authentication for those applications within the Trustpoint-managed environment.
