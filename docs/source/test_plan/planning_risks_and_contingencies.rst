   "Limited Staff Availability for Testing", "Key stakeholders or end users may have limited availability during acceptance testing.", "Schedule testing in advance; assign a test team representative if stakeholders are unavailable."
   "Incomplete or Changing Requirements", "Requirements may evolve or be incomplete, leading to rework or missed test cases.", "Conduct iterative reviews; adopt agile testing practices to adapt dynamically to changes."
   "Test Environment Instability", "The staging or test environment may become misconfigured or unavailable, causing delays.", "Maintain backup environments; use configuration checklists to ensure reliable setups."
   "Delays in Defect Resolution", "Defects may take longer to resolve, impacting subsequent testing phases.", "Prioritize critical defects; allocate additional resources for prompt resolution."
   "Dependence on External Systems", "External PKI components (e.g., Certificate Authorities) may be unavailable during testing.", "Use mock services or simulators; coordinate with service providers to ensure availability."
   "Inadequate Test Data", "Insufficient or unrealistic test data may result in incomplete testing or missed edge cases.", "Generate synthetic data using Python utilities; use anonymized production-like datasets for validation."
