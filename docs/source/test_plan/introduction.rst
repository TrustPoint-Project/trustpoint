The purpose of this test plan should be to test all required functions which are briefly described
inside the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/TrustPoint-Project/trustpoint>`_.
Also, there is a separation between functionality and user experience.
Since the project is heavily relying on securing networks as simple as possible,
the user experience should be as important as the functionality.

Summarized, this test plan is intended to ensure, through the execution and documentation of all tests, the

- functionality,
- usability,
- security and
- integration capability

of TrustPoint.
This is done by specifying and implementing the above-mentioned requirements in software tests.
