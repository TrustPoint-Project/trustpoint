The following elements are required to support the testing effort at all levels within the TrustPoint project:

#. Access to Development and Staging Environments:
    - A dedicated development environment for initial testing, debugging, and iterative fixes.
    - A staging environment that mirrors the production setup for system, integration, and acceptance testing.

#. Certificate Authority (CA) Setup:
    - Access to a functional CA system to validate PKI-related features such as certificate issuance, renewal, and revocation.

#. GitHub CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
    - An operational GitHub pipeline to automate testing and deployment workflows. This pipeline will execute unit and integration tests using pytest and behave frameworks.

#. Database Access:
    - Availability of a testing database populated with production-like data to simulate realistic scenarios.
    - A clear separation between testing and production data to ensure no overlap or accidental data modification.

#. Secure Networking Configuration:
    - A secure network environment for testing interactions between TrustPoint components, including domain validation and security protocol testing.

#. Access to Backup/Recovery Processes:
    - Access to nightly backup and recovery tools for safeguarding test environment data.

#. Testing Tools:
    - Functional installations of pytest and behave for automated testing.
    - Additional tools may be added as acceptance testing needs evolve.

This streamlined setup ensures an effective and efficient testing process while minimizing redundancy and complexity.
