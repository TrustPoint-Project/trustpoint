This chapter lists all needed requirements of Trustpoint, e.g. creating certificates.
These requirements are only back-end requirements.

------
Actors
------

First, we define all needed actors to be as specific as needed.

.. _Trustpoint-Actors-Table:

   "TPC_Web", "Trustpoint Core Web Interface", "The website of Trustpoint."
   "TP_Client", "Trustpoint Client", "The Trustpoint client program to be installed on clients."
   "Admin", "Admin", "The admin user of this specific Trustpoint environment."
   "NTEU", "Non-technically experienced user", "A user who is not necessarily technically experienced. This could also be an admin."
   "TEU", "Technically experienced user", "A user who does know at least a little bit about programming and PKI."

Next, we list all requirements.
