Since we are using the `BDD <https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/>`_ principle for system and integration testing,
we decided on specifying the tests directly inside the `Cucumber <https://cucumber.io/>`_ feature files.
This has the advantage of removing the need to keep two or more documents updated at the same time.
Also, `Gherkin <https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/>`_ is a well organized language such that the test ideas and steps
are possible to read - even for people without a background in software engineering.
That being said, we state the feature files in the following and provide a brief description on the test ideas.
