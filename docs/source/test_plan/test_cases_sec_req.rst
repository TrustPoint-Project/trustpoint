To verify that only devices with valid certificates can communicate, we will test the following scenarios:

#. Device with a Valid Certificate Can Communicate
    - A device is provisioned with a valid certificate.
    - The system allows the device to establish communication.

#. Device with an Expired Certificate is Denied
    - A device presents an expired certificate.
    - The system denies communication and logs the attempt.

#. Device with a Revoked Certificate is Denied
    - A certificate is revoked by the system administrator.
    - A device attempting to communicate with the revoked certificate is rejected.

#. Device with a Self-Signed or Untrusted Certificate is Denied
    - A device presents a self-signed certificate.
    - The system denies communication.

#. Device with a Tampered Certificate is Denied
    - A device presents a certificate with altered data.
    - The system detects the tampering and blocks communication.

#. Device Attempts Communication Without a Certificate
    - A device attempts to communicate without presenting any certificate.
    - The system rejects the request.

#. Logging of Authentication Failures
    - Every failed authentication attempt due to an invalid, expired, or revoked certificate is logged.

To verify that communication between machines is encrypted using the given algorithm, we will test the following scenarios:

#. Valid Encrypted Communication
    - Two machines establish a communication session.
    - The communication is encrypted using the specified encryption algorithm.
    - The system successfully verifies encryption.

#. Communication with No Encryption is Rejected
    - A machine attempts to communicate without encryption.
    - The system detects the unencrypted communication and blocks it.
    - The system logs the rejected attempt.

#. Communication Using an Unsupported Encryption Algorithm is Rejected
    - A machine attempts to use an encryption algorithm that is not approved.
    - The system rejects the communication.
    - The system logs the failed attempt.

#. Communication Using a Weak Encryption Algorithm is Rejected
    - A machine attempts to use a weak or deprecated encryption algorithm.
    - The system denies the communication.
    - The system logs the failure with a warning.

#. Communication is Encrypted with the Correct Key Exchange Mechanism
    - Two machines establish a secure session using the correct key exchange protocol.
    - The system verifies that the encryption is correctly applied.

#. Communication is Tamper-Resistant
    - A third party attempts to modify an encrypted message.
    - The system detects the tampering and terminates the connection.

To verify that administrators can configure security levels for different TrustPoint components, we will test the following scenarios:

#. Set Security Level for a Component
    - The admin selects a TrustPoint component.
    - The admin sets the security level to "High".
    - The system successfully applies and saves the security level.

#. Modify an Existing Security Level
    - The admin updates the security level of a component from "Medium" to "High".
    - The system correctly applies and reflects the change.

#. Invalid Security Level Input is Rejected
    - The admin attempts to set an invalid security level.
    - The system rejects the input and displays an error.

#. Security Level Persists After System Restart
    - The admin configures a security level for a component.
    - The system is restarted.
    - The security level remains correctly applied.

#. Security Level Affects System Behavior
    - A component with a high-security level enforces stricter access control.
    - A component with a low-security level has more lenient settings.
    - The system behaves accordingly.

#. Security Configuration is Logged
    - Every change to security levels is logged.
    - The log contains details such as timestamp, admin ID, and old/new security levels.

To verify that certificate template security is enforced properly, we will test the following scenarios:

#. Only Authorized Users Can Access Certificate Templates
    - A user with admin privileges accesses the certificate templates.
    - A regular user attempts to access certificate templates but is denied.

#. Secure Handling of Certificate Templates
    - A certificate template is created with restricted access.
    - The system prevents unauthorized modifications.
    - The system encrypts stored templates.

#. Modification of Certificate Templates
    - An admin updates a certificate template.
    - Unauthorized users attempt modifications but are denied.

#. Deletion Restrictions
    - Only authorized users can delete certificate templates.
    - Unauthorized users receive an error when attempting deletion.

#. Logging of Access and Modifications
    - The system logs every access and modification of certificate templates.

#. Secure Export of Certificate Templates
    - The system ensures that exported templates are encrypted.
    - Unauthorized export attempts are blocked.
