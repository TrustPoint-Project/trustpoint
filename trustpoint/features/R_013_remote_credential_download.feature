Feature: Remote Credential Download
	The system must allow users to securely download an issued application credential from a remote device without requiring user authentication.
	Instead, a one-time password (OTP) should be used to authorize the download.

	Background:
		Given the TPC_Web application is running
		
	Scenario: Admin creates one time password
		Given an issued credential is successfully issued
    	And the admin user is logged into TPC_Web
		When the admin visits the associated "Download on Device browser" view
		Then a one-time password is displayed which can be used to download the credential from a remote device
		
	Scenario: User enters one time password correctly
		Given a correct one-time password
		When the user visits the "/devices/browser" endpoint and enters the OTP
		Then they will receive a page to select the format for the credential download
		
	Scenario: User enters one time password incorrectly
		Given an incorrect one-time password
		When the user visits the "/devices/browser" endpoint and enters the OTP
		Then they will receive a warning saying the OTP is incorrect
		
	Scenario: User downloads credential on remote device browser
		Given the user is on the credential download page
		And the download token is not yet expired
		When the user enters a password to encrypt the credential private key
		And selects a file format
		Then the credential will be downloaded to their browser in the requested format
